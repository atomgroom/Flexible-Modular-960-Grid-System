# Flexible Modular 960 Grid System

This grid system is based from the original 960 grid system which can be found at http://960.grid_s/ .
It was created to build modular markup, inside of a site that already uses the original 960 grid system. 
It is best used on a site that uses nested views, mvc frameworks, etc.  

In order to use this CSS properly you'll need to have a containing DIV that uses the base 960 pixel values.
Inside this containing DIV you can write all of your markup to use the flexible grid classes(flex classes end
with an "f" ex: .grid_1f.  When you place that view within different areas of the site, the content will
flex to fill the parent container. So, a responsive philosophy, within a fixed px container size.

## Disclaimer 
I have adapted this grid system and altered it slightly from the original 960 Grid System.  You may need
to alter it to fit your environment. I am sure, like anything, it's not perfect. From my own personal
use, it works fantastic.
